<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Block Stake is a staking contract following a modified version of Sushiswap's MasterChef algorithm that takes in an upgradeable token as stake asset and issues rewards in a different token.

The users who hold the BlockStake (BST) token can earn rewards for their investments by sharing part of the rewards that are distributed per block based on their invested BST.
